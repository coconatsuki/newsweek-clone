# newsweek-clone

This is a clone of Newsweek website :

This exercise is a project from the online bootcamp "The Odin Project".
Instructions here :
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap

I added to this exercise the use of Sass (that I just learnt on CodeSchool => https://www.codeschool.com/)

So, this project was aimed to practice  :

- Bootstrap library
- SASS
- Responsive design in general.

I was quite excited to discover how fast we can build using Bootstrap, and how useful Sass can be.
CSS becomes so much cleaner thanks to Sass !
